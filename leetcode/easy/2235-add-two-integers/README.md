## Problem

Given two integers `num1` and `num2`, return  *the  **sum**  of the two integers*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: num1 = 12, num2 = 5
Output: 17
Explanation: num1 is 12, num2 is 5, and their sum is 12 + 5 = 17, so 17 is returned.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: num1 = -10, num2 = 4
Output: -6
Explanation: num1 + num2 = -6, so -6 is returned.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- -100 <= num1, num2 <= 100
