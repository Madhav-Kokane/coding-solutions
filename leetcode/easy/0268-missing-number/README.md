# Missing Number

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return  *the only number in the range that is missing from the array.* 

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [3,0,1]

 **Output:**  2

 **Explanation:** 

`n = 3` since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range `[0,3]`. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in `nums`.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [0,1]

 **Output:**  2

 **Explanation:** 

`n = 2` since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range `[0,2]`. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in `nums`.

 **Example 3:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]

 **Output:**  8

 **Explanation:** 

`n = 9` since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range `[0,9]`. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in `nums`.

 
 

 

 

 

 **Constraints:** 

- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 104
- 0 <= nums[i] <= n
- All the numbers of nums are unique.

 

 **Follow up:**  Could you implement a solution using only `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` runtime complexity?

        for(auto it : nums){
            st.insert({it});
        }

        int n=nums.size();
        for(int i=0;i<=n;i++){
            if(st.find(i) == st.end()){
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
